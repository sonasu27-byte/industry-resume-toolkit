# Industry Resume Toolkit

> English | [中文](README.md)

> **🎉 v0.2 update**: New `/创建简历` command — for people in life transitions (fresh grads / career changers / overseas returnees / gap-period restarters). AI rebuilds the resume narrative via iterative interview-style probing. **Optional upload of existing resume (LinkedIn / old version / overseas) — AI uses it as material and skips already-answered questions.** Bilingual output by default. Includes 4 user-type-specific question sets and a 7-step workflow.
>
> **v0.1** (released): Three-layer methodology + 4 company-type patterns + 12 role patterns + 4 slash commands (诊断 / 改简历 / JD匹配 / 加规则).

**A resume methodology toolkit for Chinese industry job seekers.**
**Not another AI resume generator — this codifies how a senior HR consultant actually edits resumes.**

```
Most resume projects on GitHub are for programmers, academic CVs, or generic templates.
This toolkit fills the gap:
    Tech giants, state-owned enterprises, banks, foreign companies — 
    Chinese industry job hunting.
```

## How is this different from other AI resume tools?

| Generic AI Resume Tools | Industry Resume Toolkit |
|---|---|
| Material → generate new resume | Resume → diagnose + translate + dig deeper |
| Cookie-cutter templates | Custom rules by company type (SOE / Big Tech / Bank / Multinational) |
| Increasingly polished | **Truthfulness principle**: under-state rather than over-claim |
| ATS keyword stuffing | Business value translation (action → business meaning) |
| One-shot generation | Two modes: directional advice / full hands-on rewrite |

---

## Core Methodology: Three-Layer Framework

```
Phase 1 — Information Hygiene (defuse mines)
    └─ QR codes / "preparing for" certs / split Office apps / 
       courses with tool names / cherry-picked grades
       These are not bonuses — they're penalties to avoid

Phase 2 — Business Value Translation (the core)
    └─ Action → business meaning, Tool → business result, 
       Experience → recruiter's language
       Concise headers hitting keywords / quantification / 
       "action + execution + metrics" triplet

Phase 3 — Experience Mining (only in deep mode)
    └─ Interview-style probing to fill out the story:
       business context / data scale / personal contribution / 
       results / challenges / key decisions
```

Plus **Type A (experienced) / Type B (limited experience) + career-changer modifier** classification, which determines how much effort goes into each layer.

## Company-Type Differentiation (the core USP)

| Company Type | Style | Patterns file |
|--------------|-------|---------------|
| **Big Tech (Internet / Tech)** | Quantification, JD-matching, agile, data-driven | `patterns/企业性质/大厂.md` |
| **State-Owned Enterprises** | Stable, formal, politically appropriate, long-term | `patterns/企业性质/国企.md` |
| **Banking / Finance** | Rigorous, compliant, risk-aware, numerically precise | `patterns/企业性质/银行.md` |
| **Multinationals / English CVs** | International, STAR method, strong verbs, concise | `patterns/企业性质/外企.md` |

A resume targeting an SOE looks completely different from one targeting Big Tech. Stack the **company-type pattern** with the **role-specific pattern** (`patterns/岗位/*.md` — covers Operations, PM, Finance, Audit, HR, Sales, Data, Marketing) to target your exact scenario.

---

---

## Role-Specific Patterns (the second dimension)

Company type defines the overall style; **role defines specific vocabulary, JD-matching keywords, and tool stack**. Stack both dimensions to nail the recruiter's mental model.

| Role | Covers | File |
|------|--------|------|
| **Operations(运营)** | Content / User / Activity / Community / E-commerce / Short video / Private domain | `patterns/岗位/运营.md` |
| **Product Manager** | C-end / B-end / Data product / SaaS / Platform | `patterns/岗位/产品.md` |
| **Data Analytics** | Business analyst / BI / Growth analyst | `patterns/岗位/数据分析.md` |
| **Marketing** | Brand / Digital / Content / PR / Events / KOL | `patterns/岗位/市场营销.md` |
| **Finance** | Accounting / Cashier / Financial analysis / FP&A | `patterns/岗位/财务.md` |
| **Audit** | Big 4 / Internal audit | `patterns/岗位/审计.md` |
| **HR** | HRBP / Recruiting / L&D / C&B / ER / OD | `patterns/岗位/HR.md` |
| **Sales / BD** | B2B sales / KA / BD / Account / CSM | `patterns/岗位/销售.md` |
| **Engineering** | Backend / Frontend / Full-stack / Algorithm / Data Eng / Testing / DevOps | `patterns/岗位/开发.md` |
| **Legal** | Law firm associates / In-house counsel / Compliance / IP / Data privacy | `patterns/岗位/法务.md` |
| **Strategy / Consulting** | MBB / Big 4 Strategy / Corporate strategy / Investment strategy / Equity research | `patterns/岗位/战略咨询.md` |
| **Design** | UI / UX / Visual / Product design / Interaction design / UX research | `patterns/岗位/设计.md` |

v0.1 covers 12 most-demanded roles. Contributions welcome for more (Procurement, CSM, Admin, PR, Investment, Engineering specializations, etc.). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 5 Slash Commands

```
/诊断 (diagnose)   — Run first. Tells AI your goal (role / industry / company type / language / career change)
/改简历 (edit)     — In-place job switch with intact resume — AI polishes details
/创建简历 (write)  — Life transition (fresh / career change / overseas return / gap restart). AI rebuilds the narrative via iterative probing. **Optional existing resume upload — AI uses it as material, skips already-answered questions.** Bilingual output by default ⭐ NEW in v0.2
/JD匹配 (match)    — Check your resume against a specific JD with targeted rewrite suggestions
/加规则 (add-rule)  — (Advanced) Add newly discovered rules to patterns/ on the fly
```

**`/改简历` vs `/创建简历` — when to pick which**:

| Your situation | Pick |
|---------|-------|
| Already employed, resume complete, just switching to a better role in same direction | `/改简历` |
| Fresh grad / career changer / overseas returnee / gap restarter | **`/创建简历`** |

**Note**: `/创建简历` accepts optional existing resume upload (LinkedIn / old version / overseas version). AI reads it as background, **skips already-answered questions, only asks what's missing**. The fundamental difference: `/改简历` polishes wording; `/创建简历` **rebuilds the narrative** — required for life transitions even if you have an existing resume.

## Typical Workflow

**First time**:

```bash
# 1. Drop your resume into inputs/ or directly into chat
# 2. Run diagnose to capture your profile
/诊断 inputs/resume.docx

# 3. Let AI edit your resume — outputs final .docx
/改简历
# (AI auto-evaluates info density; will ask 3-5 follow-up questions if needed)
```

**For specific JD**:

```bash
/JD匹配 inputs/resume.docx     # Then paste the JD content
```

**Input/output**: `.docx` / `.pdf` / `.md` / plain text all work. PDF input is auto-converted, you don't need to do it manually. Default output is `.docx`; AI will ask if you want Markdown / PDF / English version after editing.

## Who This Is For

✅ **Good fit**:
- Anyone wanting AI help on resumes but tired of generic templates
- Targeting **Chinese industry roles** (Big Tech / SOE / Banks / Multinationals)
- **Overseas students** returning to job-hunt in China
- **Career changers** needing to rebuild their narrative
- Used other AI tools but found them **too generic / not localized enough**

❌ **Not a fit**:
- Academic CVs (PhD / MSc applications)

---

## LLM-Agnostic

This toolkit is packaged as a Claude Code skill, but the **methodology itself is LLM-agnostic**:

- Copy `skill/SKILL.md` + `patterns/*.md` content as a prompt for ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Kimi, Doubao, Qwen, Claude.ai, etc.
- Use with Codex / Cursor / any AI agent that reads this repository

Future plans: NPM-based installer + Codex support (inspired by `xujingchen1996/research-application-toolkit`).
